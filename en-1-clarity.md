		Whatever you'd like to bring to our conversation, I would like to help you find your own path.

			<dt>Where you start?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>What are current conditions in which your challenge emerges and shows itself?
				Looking at the present state of things I can help you to find the dispositions of that state.

				It takes a lot of energy to change something that has no disposition to change. We find stepping-stones to 
				enable low-energy emergence of change in an evolutionary process.

			<dt>What direction would you like to take?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>What needs to grow, what needs to shrink? What stories would you like to hear
				or tell more often, which stories would you like to see fewer of? What needs to be amplified, what should be dampened? 

				Every change involves something new being born, and something existing to cease. The letting go part is sometimes overlooked. But it might
				be more difficult to let go than acting on the new. There are typically very good reasons why individuals, teams or organizations cannot
				let go of existing habits. Those tend to have a specific important function for the system, even if that function is not always conscious 
				or visible. However, if you can't let go of what is now, the best plan for execution will not help.</p>

		The basic processes of living happen to organizations, teams and individuals. Yet do they go through their existence with awareness of these processes? 
		Individuals are born, as are companies. Neither are meant to stagnate. Groups become teams, but those may yet dissolve. Projects begin and end. 
		But what does it mean to truly grow?   

		Being born and giving birth is painful and disorienting, it hurts and is fraught with uncertainties. And yet in our memory, new beginnings may be the 
		most beautiful things. Is there something that tries to be born in your life?

		I could help you navigate your next beginning.
