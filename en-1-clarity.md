Whatever you'd like to bring to our conversation, I would like to help you find your own path to clarity:
</p>
<p>
<b>Where you start?</b> What are current conditions in which your challenge emerges and shows itself?
Looking at the present state of things I can help you to find the dispositions of that state.

It takes a lot of energy to change something that has no disposition to change. We find stepping-stones to 
enable low-energy emergence of change in an evolutionary process.

<b>What direction would you like to take?</b> What needs to grow, what needs to shrink? What stories would you like to hear
or tell more often, which stories would you like to see fewer of? What needs to be amplified, what should be dampened? 

Every change involves something new being born, and something existing to cease. The letting go part is sometimes overlooked. But it might
be more difficult than acting on the new. If you can't let go of what is now, the best plan for execution will not help.
 
<b>What constraints do you want to set?</b> Limit your invest etc. what do you say no to?

		Organizing creates identities.

		What is at the core of these identities? Expertise? Common goals?

		Organizing is a process, organization is temporary.

I'd like to help your change to be born and grow


There are many changes and challenges in every persons life: You might have hard decisions to make. Difficulties in your interactions with other 
people in your life. A new team starts up and that creates a new purpose and identity. After a project ends you feel without direction. Your organization
needs to adapt to new conditions.


What does it mean to truly grow?
Being born and giving birth is painful and disorienting, it hurts and is fraught with uncertainties. And yet new beginnings may be the 
most beautiful memories we have. Is there something that tries to be born in your life?
I could help you navigate your next beginning.


How do you act in the world under uncertainty?


 
I'd like to help you gain clarity.

In order to change we need to figure out where we are, and what direction we want to take. Then we try to take the first step.

<b>Purpose</b> 

why do you exist|what do you believe needs to happen? What outcome would you like to achieve? How do you, how does the team, how does the organization

	<p>
	The basic processes of living happen to organizations, teams and individuals. Yet do they go through their existence with awareness of these processes? 
	Individuals are born, as are companies. Neither are meant to stagnate. Groups become teams, but those may yet dissolve. Projects begin and end. 
	
	I invite you 
	to imagine what your world looks like when our collaboration ends successfully.
