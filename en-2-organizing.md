		<p>
		Boundaries occur everywhere. Everything has limits. All the while we live in a culture that preaches extractive growth, at any cost.
		And to grow we need to become ever more efficient and effective. But limits can only be pushed so far. 
		</p>
		<h3>We need to re-define what it means to be effective</h3> 
		<p>Effectiveness means we need to learn to deal with the boundaries and the limits in all domains of our lives. Productively, joyful, collaborative.</p>
		<p>
		The key to unlocking potential lies in our interactions within and across boundaries. How would it feel to renegotiate the balance at your boundaries? 
		Could we change the quality of a given boundary? Or the quality of the connection across it?
		</p>
		<p>
		I'd like to help you change and re-balance the boundaries, so all needs are met, and all boundaries respected, be it personal, social, ethical or ecological.
