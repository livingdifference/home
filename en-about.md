			<h2>Hello, I'm Matthias...</h2>
		</header>

		<!-- Content -->
		<p>
		I have a background in the natural sciences and technology. From there started a journey that shaped my way of seing and being in the world, and my way of working.
		I saw from the inside what working in large western industrial organizations and companies can do to people's mind and spirit. Most of what I experienced felt not right.
		</p>
		<h3>facilitating</h3>
		<p>		
		Creating spaces for joyful collaboration thus became a priority. It led me to learn agile methods, <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/" target="_blank">liberating structures</a>, 
		<a href="https://creativefacilitation.com/" target="_blank">creative facilitation</a> and the power of <a href="https://playonpurpose.com/" target="_blank">play on purpose</a>.
		I became able to use these methods to create pockets of new experience and reflection for staff and managers. Today, I enjoy facilitating events for smart participants, who bring their energy and enjoy
		the work. Of course, when events are designed to bring out these energies in people, that is more likely to happen. Nobody's grumpy or bored by nature. <i>Meetings that people 
		want to come to</i> are possible.
		</p>
		
		<h3>coaching</h3>	
		<p>
		The quest of understanding the interplay between individuals and social context led me to train as a systemic coach. Systemic, because I work with you in <i>your context</i>. 
		Coach, because I work <i>with and for you</i> in your context. In coaching, I try to help by creating resonance in you. I ask questions to help you explore your own disposition
		towards a change or course of action. Be it a decision, a conflict or a long-held goal you tried to reach. My role is to strengthen and support the inner direction of the individual
		so they may flourish and self-actualize in balance and connection with their environment. A lot of change can start with you, you can become and make a living difference.
        </p>
		
		<h3>organizing</h3>	
		<p>
		But no matter how willing an individual person might desire some change in the world, and no matter how much you might be willing to start with change yourself: all too often 
		the environments and organizations we find ourselves in co-determine much of our interactions and communication patterns. Change is always a complex interplay between the 
		individual person and the collective. That's true for companies, teams or families alike. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For a few years, I worked as a change agent and organization consultant for a large financial institution. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Here, my journey came full circle. The fact that large organizations with industrial cultures and thought-patterns feel lifeless for many of their members will not change even if
		all the members get individual coaching, or if there's a good meeting every now and then.
		</p>
		<p>
		I saw how organisations are made. Someone decides the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsLmjoAp_Dg" target="_blank"><!-- Dave Snowden -->formal structure and the formal constraints</a>, the 
		formal goals. Then people (self)-organize around those constraints and conditions. Often they feel they have no power to change 'the system'. Sometimes, that is even true of those managing the 
		system. CEOs feel market pressures, politicians voter pressures. Metaphorically, the entire organization becomes a new 'living being' of its own. Organizing both shapes the identities of
		consituting individuals, and creates new identities. 
		</p>
		<p>
		That in turn has major implications for the structure and the qualities of our products and outputs: we live in a 
		world of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA_c6Xo806g" target="_blank">socio-technical systems</a>. What we want to produce, what we need to create needs to inform 
		how we organize and vice versa. 
		</p>
		<h3>the future</h3>
		<p>
		Predictions are hard, especially about the future. Here's mine: we'll need a lot of human ingenuity, a lot of collaboration, common and mutual understanding, co-creation and decision making to address
		our challenges as human civilization. Yet all ingenuity and cleverness will not overcome the fact that our planet and life on it has physical limits as to what it can regenerate
		and hence provide.
		</p>
		<p>
		I believe a just and humane society within planetary boundaries is possible and worth striving for. I even believe that in this society life will feel abundantly rich. 
		But to get there, we need to un-learn the impulse for ever more - be it material wealth, status or power - and replace it with a sense of joyful sufficiency. My passion is co-creating 
		our regenerative future with you: a future when we stop extracting more from people and planet than we give back to it. One source of inspiration for my work are therefore 
		the <a href="https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/" target="_blank">Inner Development Goals</a>.

I believe we need to make a difference between what a single person can achieve - the difference you can make -
		and what can be achieved collectively.
		
		
		
		So we need to gain some insight into the current system (mapping by sensemaker), we need to get a sense of direction    make the system perceive itself    stepping stones that can bring us
		from our current situation to something closer to our desires.
		imagine the future while not becoming blind to novelty and opportunity along the way.
		along the way we may find that we cannot become what we say we want to become. then we need to explore the hidden commitments to behaviors, feelings and values that stabilize and re-produce
		our current state. These certainly have a function in our live; but if we truly want to evolve ourselves, we need to incorporate these functions in a larger context.
		
		
		
		The way we organize strongly influences how we interact. We ourselves or someone else decides
