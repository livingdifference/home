                        It is crucial to develop awareness of what actually is. What avenues of action are available to you at this time?
                        Setting a direction of travel and taking a step is more important than a detailed plan for the next few years.

                            <p>It is of the essence to know where you are and what is possible or plausible in terms of next steps.  
                            Statements about how things should be will not bring about change, and telling people to 'just change' or 'grow'
                            or 'develop themselves' is just as unhelpful as telling others they 'didn't have the right mindset'.</p>

                            <p>Still we can use aspiration as a guide to set a new direction.</p>

                            <p>Still individuals and their responsibility are important, and in many ways they are still the primary source of
                            change. And yet it is even more important to take the social system into view that the individual is part of.
                            Still more important to enable groups, organizations or networks to be effective through collaboration.

                                            <h3>Who or what can act?</h3>

                                            <p>Who has what power to do something or over something in a social system?</p>
                                            <p>Who or what is within your sphere of influence?
                                            In our culture we often hear talk of individual growth for individual success. We're asked to just do
                                            the right thing - individually. Yet so many important social and environmental goals are made difficult to contribute to
                                            by the individual due to the way the systems are set up. </p>
                                            <p>If cities are built for cars, it is a hard ask
                                            that people move by foot. If upstream processes produce lots of errors even the most conscientious people
                                            in downstream processes are not going to be able to control for good quality.
                                            A soccer team might be composed of individual super heroes, if they don't play together, they'll still lose.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>The distribution of agency, of power, within a system, as well as the way the system engages participants in
                                            collaboration is more important than appeals to individual responsibility and agency.
                                            </p>

                                            How could you go about influencing within your circle of influence - and how could you widen it?

                                            You might think that cutting down the Amazon forest is unethical and irresponsible - but if there is no
                                            alternative to feed your family, you might still do it. You have no <i>real</i> choice.

                                            Mindset is not a helpful term, because it pretends that all action or inaction depends and is grounded in the individual. Basically
                                            you fail because well, you don't have a growth mindset. Poor you.

                                            Utopia doesn't come about because everyone becomes a saint in an impossible environment.

                                            <p>
                                            what options of behavior, what choices or ways of action are available to someone in their environment (Includes own history.)?

                                            all you can do is the next right thing.

                                            What are all the small stories, beliefs and anecdotes that pattern the way someone sees the world?
                                            What stories do you tell yourself about your influence? Whom or what do your stories typically center around?
                                            Maybe we can start consciously to try to live and write new stories. Stories just at the border of your current
                                            circle of influence.

                                            How could you gather courage for action where you feel you lack it?
                                            History matters and path dependency is a key aspect of any human system
                                            even if a system provides the affordance for change, the assemblages may prevent action, or even visibility of the opportunity.
