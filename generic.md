<h2>organizing for effectiveness</h2>

blah

<h2>philosophy</h2>

Boundaries occur everywhere: the planet, the team. Limits of performance of a team or an individual. We may tend to focus on the individual to improve. Is that the key to unlocking potential? What about the interfaces? The interactions? 

How would it feel to renegotiate the balance at the boundary? 
Could we change the quality of the boundary? Or the quality of the connection across it?

Iâ€™d like to help you change and balance the boundaries.
