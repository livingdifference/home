		Whether you are an individual, a group or an organization - I'd like to help you weave the web of your life.

				<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-comments"></i> Coaching</h3>
				<p>
				Bring your head and your heart into a conversation with each other.
				Come into balance with your inner and outer environments. 
				Become aware of yourself and the many contexts you're a part of. 
				You co-create your life! What you focus your attention on has a strong 
				impact on you and your world. 
				<!-- Help with failed attempts at changing behavior. -->

				<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-users-line"></i> Facilitation</h3>
				<p>Let's meet at workshops, offsites and gatherings with smart and playful participants. 
				Let's meet to have an impact: to decide, bond, learn and do. 
				When meetings are facilitated with such people and objectives in mind,
				you get stuff done, and you might just as well enjoy the process.	
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>playful and structured</li>
					<li>creative and solution-focused</li>

				<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-forward"></i> Organizing</h3>
				<p>Organisations are not machines. People will always self-organize around the formal constraints 
				of the organization. And that is an adaptive advantage. When groups and teams make their own rules, they tend to be the most
				effective. Let's help self-organization to be born and strengthend. I can guide you to set helpful boundaries.

				<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> Individuals</h3>
				<p>
				I listen to you with my full attention. I can ask you questions to discover new insights about yourself and
				your situation. I can help you to find your own path through your lifes challenges. Because you know your
				life best, I will not give you advice. Rather, my goal is to co-create ideas and images that resonate with 
				you.

				<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> Teams</h3>
				<p>
				I help all voices to be heard. Those of the inner teams of all members, and those of every person.
				I support the group to form its own voice, to become conscious of the group becoming a team - a system
				that follows its own goals and has its own needs.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>discover the energies and talents available to the group</li>
					<li>find common purpose</li>

				<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-tree"></i> Organizations</h3>
				<p>
				Organizing is a process that creates identity. It enables adaptation to the environment, so the organized can be effective in 
				their environment.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>think through organizational constraints, boundary conditions </li>
					<li>find and establish ways of organizing work that fit the work and the environment in which it happens</li>
					<li>strengthen self-organization and emergence as adaptive mechanisms</li>
