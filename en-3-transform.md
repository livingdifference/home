			... but rather, it is meant to transform into a butterfly. When it starts transforming, it has been very effective in its own environment
			eating up all the leafs - the basis of its very life. Transformation becomes an imperative. It involves unlearning to be a caterpillar and
			re-shaping the boundaries of its body, its perception and its behavior. Their behavior becomes regenerative: they pollinate flowers.

				<p>What do you leave behind? What would you like to let go of? What is your legacy going to be? 
				   Often, we’d rather not think about the end of life of anything: our projects, products, or the planet. 
				   What would happen were we to look at the beginning and the ending, value and the waste, life and death, head and heart, joy and suffering? 
				   For example: can we create circular economies without re-imagining what 'waste' is? Can we live deeply without thinking about our end? 
				   Life is about bounded processes. Inner and outer, and the membrane between.

				Knowing and savoring the boundaries might be one key to a good life for the individual, the group, the organization. 
				Because the differences we establish make our world. They organize. And create identities in the process. They make all the difference.
				I can help you spot the difference, help you play with and transform with it.
